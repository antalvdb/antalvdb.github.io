# Transformers: Applications in Language and Communication

This website accompanies the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) [Applied Data Science Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) course **Transformers: Applications in Language and Communication**.  

> This course introduces you to Transformers, introduced in
> {cite}`10.5555/3295222.3295349`. With the release of ChatGPT in
> November 2022, the Transformer, the T in GPT, firmly took position
> as the number one working horse in AI. It changed the field of
> natural language processing (the field of this course's lecturers)
> overnight, and its revolutionary industrial impact might be huge and
> lasting. Yet, the working horse at its core can only do one
> thing: *predict the next word*. How can a next-word predictor show
> good aptitude at school tests? How is it able to reason? What are
> the problematic aspects of this technology, and what are the current
> developments?

The [Applied Data Science
Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) program is
a one-year Master program. The live course is held yearly in
February-April. The current webpages reflect the course content from
the 2025 issue.

The content was created by [Antal van den
Bosch](https://antalvandenbosch.nl/), [Lisa
Bylinina](https://bylinina.github.io/), Yingjin Song, and [Yupei
Du](https://yupei.nl/). Guest lectures were given by [Lukas
Edman](https://leukas.github.io/cv/), [Fabian
Ferrari](https://www.fabianlferrari.com/), and Jakub Zavrel ([Zeta
Alpha](https://www.zeta-alpha.com/)). [Tijmen
Baarda](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/TCBaarda) and [Arjan
Mossel](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/AMossel) were teaching
assistants. We took an effort in properly quoting and crediting
content of others; please notify [Antal van den
Bosch](mailto:a.p.j.vandenbosch@uu.nl) in case the current material
needs a correction or a credit.

Some of the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) accompanying the
course (that have been optimized to run on [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)) are based on the notebooks
that came with the book [Natural Language Processing with
Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/)
by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. Other sources
of inspiration are quoted in the respective lecture slides and Jupyter
notebooks.

The images containing imaginary Transformer bots in various lab or
outside settings were created in
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home), with prompts that
always included "1950s science fiction book cover style".
