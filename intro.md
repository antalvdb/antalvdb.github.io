# Transformers: Applications in Language and Communication

This website accompanies the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) [Applied Data Science Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) course **Transformers: Applications in Language and Communication**.

The [Applied Data Science Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) program is a one-year Master program. The live course is held yearly in February-April. The current webpages reflect the course content from the 2025 issue.

The content was created by Antal van den Bosch, Lisa Bylinina, Yingjin
Song, and Yupei Du. We took an effort in properly quoting and
crediting content of others; please notify [Antal van den
Bosch](mailto:a.p.j.vandenbosch@uu.nl) in case the current material
needs a correction.

Some of the Jupyter Notebooks accompanying the course (that have been
optimized to run on Google Colab) are based on the notebooks that came
with the book [Natural Language Processing with
Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/)
by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. Other sources
of inspiration are quoted in the respective notebooks.

The images containing imaginary Transformer bots in various lab or
outside settings were created in
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home), with prompts that
always included "1950s science fiction book cover style".
