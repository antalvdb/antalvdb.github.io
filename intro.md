This website accompanies the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) [Applied Data Science Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) course **Transformers: Applications in Language and Communication**.

The [Applied Data Science Master](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/applied-data-science) program is a one-year Master program. The live course is held yearly in February-April. The current webpages reflect the course content from the 2025 issue.

The content was created by [Antal van den
Bosch](https://antalvandenbosch.nl/), [Lisa
Bylinina](https://bylinina.github.io/), Yingjin Song, and [Yupei
Du](https://yupei.nl/). We took an effort in properly quoting and
crediting content of others; please notify [Antal van den
Bosch](mailto:a.p.j.vandenbosch@uu.nl) in case the current material
needs a correction or a credit.

Some of the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) accompanying the
course (that have been optimized to run on [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)) are based on the notebooks
that came with the book [Natural Language Processing with
Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/)
by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. Other sources
of inspiration are quoted in the respective lecture slides and Jupyter
notebooks.

The images containing imaginary Transformer bots in various lab or
outside settings were created in
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home), with prompts that
always included "1950s science fiction book cover style".
