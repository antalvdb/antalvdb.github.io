        "This Applied Data Science course introduces you to Transformers, a class of deep learning neural networks based on the Transformer architecture. Although this architecture was introduced relatively recently, in [this 2017 paper](https://https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf), history did not start in 2017. Many of the components in and ideas behind the Transformer have a history that harks back to the first wave of neural network research ([McCulloch & Pitts, 1943](https://https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf); [Rosenblatt, 1958](https://https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-09865-001); [Minsky & Papert, 1969](https://https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3132/PerceptronsAn-Introduction-to-Computational)), as well as the second wave ([Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262680530/parallel-distributed-processing/); [Elman, 1990](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1402_1)).\n",

        "Although we will focus on Transformers in this course, in this seminar notebook we will cover some wider basics of [Hugging Face](https://https://huggingface.co/) (🤗), the platform for maintaining, downloading and running Transformer models and related architectures and tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook and some of the following seminar notebooks we follow, broadly, the book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/), by 🤗 staff members Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. See the [full notebook collection](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks) for this book.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please read through the examples, run the code, edit it at will and re-run it, and do the exercises left open for you. In the first seminar, no exercises are given, but they will be more common in the weeks leading up to the midterm assignment, which will consists of a number of notebook exercises. At the end of each week, solutions to the exercises are published on the course's Teams channel.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note: It is important to select GPU as the runtime engine (under 'Runtime', check 'change runtime type' and change type). Google Colab kindly provides T4 GPU in their free tier, which will allow you to run small experiments that run in limited time. For most of our purposes, free-tier Google Colab will be a sufficient resource. When starting training runs, stay aware of the limitations and do check progress bars when they start running. If processes are expected to take more than 12 hours, it is advised to abandon the job and change hyperparameters to reduce process load.*"

The main advantage of this model is that it achieves comparable performance to BERT, while being significantly smaller and more efficient. This enables us to train a classifier in a few minutes, and if you want to train a larger BERT model you can simply change the checkpoint of the pretrained model.
